                    The Founders of the company began with the idea that every person should have a watch they can wear which doesnt make a hole in their poket.<br><br>
             When ever a person wanted to buy a reasonable watch that looked like it was tailored to them, this was nearly impossible in the current condition of the market.<br><br>
             We saw this problem as we were also the ones that were facing them as a customer and founded HASA Watches. This Company is dedicated to gather the best inventory
             of watches in the market to give it's customers the best products. We as a company share the same compassion for watches like our customers and believe to make this 
             company a customer driven company. <br><br>
             While we are proud of selling only the best of watches online to all people Australia-wide, we share a lot of compassion for conserving the enivronment.
             We as company only use Bio-degardable.<br><br>

             Along with this, we belive in giving back to the community. As of now, more than 50% of the profits are being donated to local charities which can help in the upliftment of
             lives.<br> There is a very famous saying that we follow: <span id="saying"><h2>"Its not your or my community, its our community."</h2></span>
